        Hello! I’m Jenguel, but you can call me Noyan. I’ve been living abroad
        since 2012, and currently, I’m residing in Tokyo, Japan. My life is
        enriched by diverse cultures and experiences. I love riding my bike,
        exploring the city's streets, and attending various events.

        On my Twitch streams, I aim to bring together my passion for chatting
        and gaming to create enjoyable moments for all of us. Each stream is a
        great opportunity to make new friends and have fun together. We can
        discuss strategies while playing different games, talk about my biking
        adventures, or you can ask me anything about life in Tokyo.
      </p>

        Join my channel and be part of this exciting journey. Looking forward to
        engaging chats and fun gaming sessions with all of you!
